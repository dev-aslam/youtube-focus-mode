## YouTube Focus Mode

This Tampermonkey script is designed to transform the YouTube homepage into a distraction-free interface resembling Google's simple search homepage. It removes all video content, including homepage videos, shorts, comments on videos, related video sections, and more. Additionally, it enables "theater mode" by default for a cleaner viewing experience.
